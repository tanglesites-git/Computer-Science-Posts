# Polymorphism

> What is polymorphism? If you Google it, you will get some esoteric definition about many-shapes or many-forms, but we need more than the etymology of word to make practicle use of the word. Polymorphism is substituting a base class say `Animal` for a subclass `Cat`. This subtitution allows one `type` to have many shapes: `Cat`, `Dog`, `Bird` etc. I do not know if you caught that I slipped in the word `type`. You see programming is all about types and mappings of types either from a type to itself or from a type to a different type. There are other principles of Programming like state, scope concurrency etc. But those will other posts for the future. The type **`int`** can have only one shape. By this I mean it has a pre-defined size and range of values. That is to say when the compiler reads a declaration of type **`int`** it knows that an **`int`** has only one size in memory, and if the value assigned to the declaration is valid. There is no guessing. So if **`int`** is a type and it can only have one form, it must be static. It cannot change. So types are not polymorphic. But what if we created a type `Whole Number` that sat under the type **`int`** in the type hierarchy. Polymorphism would let us substitute an instance of `Whole Number` where ever **`int`** was present. 
But what is a hierarchy?
